## Code Quality & Architecture Improvements

### Project Structure Enhancements
- [x] Organize build scripts into `/scripts` or `/tools` directory
- [ ] Create browser-specific asset folders if project grows
- [x] Consider `/src` directory for core logic and `/public` for static assets
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams or flowcharts for contributor onboarding

### Code Quality & Development
- [x] Implement TypeScript for type safety and better tooling
- [ ] Add unit tests for core logic (time calculations, API integration)
- [x] Set up ESLint or similar for consistent code style
- [ ] Consider bundler (Webpack, Vite) for optimization and dependency management
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected responses for maintainers

### Build & Release System
- [ ] Add CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions) for automated builds and linting
- [ ] Implement automated packaging and upload to browser stores
- [ ] Add automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Set up code quality checks in CI

### Extension Architecture
- [ ] Review and implement more granular permissions (least privilege principle)
- [ ] Further abstract browser APIs for better cross-browser support
- [ ] Add opt-in telemetry or error reporting for better support
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms

### Security & Performance
- [ ] Audit permissions and reduce to minimum required
- [ ] Implement content security policy review
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for API calls
- [ ] Review and optimize bundle sizes

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for browser extension functionality
- [ ] Set up automated browser testing across different versions

### Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines and code of conduct
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide with common issues
- [ ] Document extension architecture and data flow
- [ ] Add performance and security considerations to docs
