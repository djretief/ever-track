# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder icon files for the EverTrack Safari extension.

For a production extension, you would need to replace these with actual PNG icon files:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icons should represent time tracking and should be:
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent with Safari's design language
- Clear on both light and dark backgrounds

Suggested design elements:
- Clock face
- Progress bar/chart
- Timer icon
- Combination of clock + chart elements

You can create these icons using design tools like:
- Sketch
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators
